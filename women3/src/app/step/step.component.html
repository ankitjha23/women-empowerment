              The Ministry has been administering ‘Support to Training and Employment Programme for Women (STEP) Scheme’ since
              1986-87 as a ‘Central Sector Scheme’. The STEP Scheme aims to provide skills that give employability to women and to
              provide competencies and skill that enable women to become self-employed/entrepreneurs. The Scheme is intended to
              benefit women who are in the age group of 16 years and above across the country. The grant under the Scheme is given
              to an institution/ organisation including NGOs directly and not the States/ UTs. The assistance under STEP Scheme will
              be available in any sector for imparting skills related to employability and entrepreneurship, including but not

              The functionaries of the implementing agencies and the link agencies and the voluntary
              organisations involved would initially be given a suitable orientation towards the scope, objectives
              and requirements under the projects for the effective implementation of the project. Sensitization
              towards women’s issue will be an integral part of training at all levels including the project
              implementing agencies and the beneficiaries as well.
          </p>
          <p>
              Women will be given training on various aspects, including group formation, skill
              upgradation management of the primary producer groups and co-operatives, entrepreneurship skills,
              marketing, awareness of their rights and gender concern etc. So as to equip them to face, overcome
              and resolve their economic and social constraints and problems at their own level and to promote
              genuine empowerment. This is the basic approach towards the evaluation of the Status of women.
          </p>
          <p>
              The implementing agency in the project formulation will outline the training arrangements of
              the beneficiaries, extension workers, field supervisors and technical staff, etc. identifying the training
              institute, guidelines of training, cost estimate etc. No additional training institute will be established.
              The existing infrastructure already available will be uplifted and Training will be through accredited
              agencies/Trainers. NIPCCD will coordinate the training arrangements and ensure that the training is
              imparted not only in the technical trade to upgrade the skills of market management, but also in
              gender sensitization, gender awareness, including legal literacy and sensitization.
